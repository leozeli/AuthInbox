# Auth Inbox üì¨

[English](https://github.com/TooonyChen/AuthInbox/blob/main/README.md) | [‰∏≠Êñá](https://github.com/TooonyChen/AuthInbox/blob/main/README_CN.md)

**Auth Inbox** is an open-source project that securely manages and views authentication emails using [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/)'s free services, so you don't need to set up your own servers. It automatically processes incoming emails, extracts verification codes or links, and stores them in a database. A user-friendly web interface is provided for administrators to easily review the extracted information. AuthInbox also supports real-time notifications via Bark, making it a comprehensive and hassle-free solution for email authentication management.

Don't wanna receive ads and spams on your main email? Want a bunch of alternative email for register services and websites? Try this!

   ```bash
   npm install wrangler -g
   ```
   Create a [Google AI Studio API](https://aistudio.google.com/) and have a domain binded on your [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) account

2. **Initialization**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TooonyChen/AuthInbox.git
   cd AuthInbox
   npm install
   ```

3. **create d1 database**

   When you execute the [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/) login command for the first time, you will be prompted to log in. Just follow the prompts.

   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 execute inbox-d1 --local --file=./schema.sql # creating a d1 database called 'inbox-d1'
   ```
   you will get the result like this:
   ```bash
   ‚úÖ Successfully created DB 'inbox-d1'

   [[d1_databases]]
   binding = "DB" # available in your Worker on env.DB
   database_name = "inbox-d1"
   database_id = "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
   ```
   please copy the result from your terminal, you will use them in the next step

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

Use `wrangler.toml` file in the project root with the necessary environment variables:

   ```toml
   name = "auth-inbox"
   type = "typescript"
   
   [vars]
   UseBark = 'true' # set 'true' to use or 'false' to not use
   barkUrl = "https://api.day.app"
   barkTokens = 'xxxxxxxxx' # set to your bark tokens on your iOS device, download it from https://bark.day.app/
   FrontEndAdminID = 'admin' # your login
   FrontEndAdminPassword = 'password' # your password
   GoogleAPIKey = 'xxxxxxxxxxx' # your google api, go to https://aistudio.google.com/ to generate one if u dont have

   [[d1_databases]] # Copy the lines obtained from step 2 from your terminal.
   binding = "DB"
   database_name = "inbox-d1" # Copy from step 2
   database_id = "<unique-ID-for-your-database>" # Copy from step 2
   ```
4. **Deploy your own worker** üåê
   Deploy your Worker to make your project accessible on the Internet. Run:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```
   You will get output like this:
   ```
   Outputs: https://auth-inbox.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev
   ```
